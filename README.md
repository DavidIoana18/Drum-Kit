# ü•Å Drum-Kit ü•Å

The game is a virtual drum kit where users can click on drum buttons or press specific keys to play different drum sounds. Each interaction triggers a sound and a brief button animation, creating a realistic drumming experience.

In this project **JavaScript** is used for:

- **User interactions** by detecting clicks on drum buttons and keypresses.
- **Sound playback** with a specific sound for each button or key, making the drum sounds respond to user input.
- **Button animations** for visual feedback, adding and removing a class briefly to show a pressed effect.

**DOM manipulation** is used to:
- connect JavaScript with HTML elements.
- enabling sounds and animations to play each time the user clicks a button or presses a key.
